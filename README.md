# js-todo-list
 Basic to do list created with JavaScript


#18 NOV 21
Finally decided to learn JavaScript. Learn by doing is my favorite method and what better way to start of this journey than to create a classic to do list. ðŸ˜‰

Did not create initalize repository right away as I planned on having a single file for playing around which included keep JS and CSS code inside HTML file.

Further separation to follow.
