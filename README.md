# js-todo-list
 Basic to do list created with vanilla JavaScript (+ HTML and CSS, of course).

Below is my development log.

Oh. This is also me just using search engine and JS docs to build this.
Not following any tutorial. I don't think there's anything wrong with it but I preffer learning something by tackling the issues and doing it my way (not re-inventing the wheel). You get what I mean.

Finally decided to learn JavaScript. Learn by doing is my favorite method and what better way to start of this journey than to create a classic to do list. ðŸ˜‰

Did not create initalize repository right away as I planned on having a single file for playing around which included keep JS and CSS code inside HTML file.

Further separation to follow.

This is my 8th day in a row on call, there's been a lot of issues in the system so did not have much time to play around this. Today I was able to sit down and finish up intended functionality I though of for now.
I'll start with the design.
Might use Sass, tried it once when doing RoR project in 4th year of college, it seemed fun.

Starting with the design. I'll use Material Design Lite as my CSS library. Used MD while developing Android app for final project in the last year of college. 
We'll see what I make of it.
