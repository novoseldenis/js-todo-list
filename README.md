# js-todo-list
 Basic to do list created with vanilla JavaScript (+ HTML and CSS, of course).

Below is my development log.

Finally decided to learn JavaScript. Learn by doing is my favorite method and what better way to start of this journey than to create a classic to do list. ðŸ˜‰

Did not create initalize repository right away as I planned on having a single file for playing around which included keep JS and CSS code inside HTML file.

Further separation to follow.

This is my 8th day in a row on call, there's been a lot of issues in the system so did not have much time to play around this. Today I was able to sit down and finish up intended functionality I though of for now.
I'll start with the design.
Might use Sass, tried it once when doing RoR project in 4th year of college, it seemed fun.
